# stock-price

In this data project I have analysed data of stock prices.
I have used bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

this project uses pandas-datareader, ie, instead of a local file, I have taken data from the internet.

I have taken the data of following companies:

-Bank of America
-CitiGroup
-Goldman Sachs
-JPMorgan Chase
-Morgan Stanley
-Wells Fargo

this project uses multiple libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy.
